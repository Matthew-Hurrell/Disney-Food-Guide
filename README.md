## Wireframes 

The project templates and wireframes for Disney Food Guide were designed using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com). The designs vary from the end layout in some places due to creative decisions made throughout the development process.

## Site Structure 

Disney Food Guide has five pages freely accessable by using the on site navigation. These pages are the [home page](index.html), which is the default loading page, [restaurants](restaurants.html), [snacks](snacks.html), [drinks](drinks.html) and [contact](contact.html). There is one other page which is viewed in response to the contact form submission, that page is [thanks](thanks.html) but this page isn't accessable via the normal site navigation. The navigation bar is present on every page of the website. This nav is replaced by a mobile sticky nav on smaller devices which follows the screen when the user continues down the pages. All three pages which feature the listed items are quite long so a back to the top link was added to the footer of the pages to make navigation back to the top easier. These links disappear on smaller devices as the nav bar is always visible. The logo at the top left of the nav bar can also be used as a link to the home page. There is also a scroll down clickable link box on the home page main header image which provides a visual queue for the user to scroll down to view the welcome text as the main header takes up the entire page. When clicked this box scrolls the view down to the lower section. This box disappears on smaller devices.

## Design Choices 

* ### Typography 

The font family chosen for Disney Food Guide was Montserrat, with a backup font of sans-serif. This font family was used for all text across the site. It was chosen for its professional yet playful feel which is easy to read. It matched well with the lighthearted tone of the content whilst still remaining formal enough to not look unprofessional. The font was selected from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). To cut down on load times only font weights of 300 and 400 were chosen. The font was imported using a link in [the CSS document](assets/css/style.css).

* ### Colour Scheme 

The colour scheme used was a variation on the classic Disney colour scheme. Mostly a combination of whites, pinks, blacks and orange yellows with varying degrees of transparency to provide different shades. The text colour is a dark grey so as not to appear to dark. Social media icons transition to their signature colours when hovered over. The light colours throughout the site help to generate a soft and welcoming atmosphere. Orange is a colour of optimism, freedom and youth. Pink is a calm, soft and creative colour. Yellow is a colour often associated with fun, happiness, joy and positivity. Together these colours capture the youthful spirit of Disney. A blue background image is used for the contact page as blue is a colour of trust, confidence and purpose. This may help generate more confidence and trust in the user to submit their details.
